# Stoicos
##Concept
The Stoicos is a custom made language interpreted in ruby.
Its concept is base on the fact taht it uses a simple lexer/parser with means that all that needs to be done to extend this language is to add new functions.
The major flaw of this language (in my opinion) is the fact there are no syntaxic sugar, meaning this language tends to be less readable when expanding.

##How to use
Write your code in a txt file then use this command line :
> Main.rb My_file_name.txt

With no argument given the file Test.txt will be oppened by default.

##Example
You can look at Example.txt for som code example. Also Database.txt give a tiny database example.
