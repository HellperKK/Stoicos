Here I will add the things I want to add to the version 4.

Things I'm sure I can do :
- Change the syntax so it is not based on newlines and tabs anymore.
- Allow the user to extend the language by importing ruby files.
- Allow the user to configure some behaviour of the language.
- Add a lot of new behaviours to the language (with the ability to configure them in mind).

Things I'd like to do but don't know how
- Rewrite the lexer/parser to allow more fancy syntax.
- Revisit the type system

Things I used to do but am not sure I will finally do
- Think about exceptions (throwing and handling)
