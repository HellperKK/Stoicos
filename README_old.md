# Stoicos
##Concept
The Stoicos is a custom made language interpreted in ruby.
Its concept is based on the fact that it uses a simple lexer/parser with means that all that needs to be done to extend this language is to add new functions.
The major flaw of this language (in my opinion) is the fact there are no syntaxic sugar, meaning this language tends to be less readable when expanding.

##Version
Two versions of the interpretor are in devellopement. 

The version 1 is the oldest one but is functionnal.

The version 2 is young and not yet functionnal.
